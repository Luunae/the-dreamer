# The Dreamer is currently a simple utility bot.

[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

Its features are:
- A `!teleport` (alias: `!tp`) function:
Redirect to a different channel.
- A `!unshort` (alias: `!us`) function:
Reply to a message with this command to repost an unshortened Youtube link.

- Quote Unrolling (No command, simply link a discord message in the same server):
Sends a message quoting the message found at the link.


Don't come to me asking for help, I barely know what this is doing.

# Now with 100% more CURSED!
